Hi there,

Welcome to my blog. Let me tell you a little about myself. My name is Brad Ringel, I'm 21 years old and I'm from the suburbs of Cleveland Ohio. I currently attend Indiana University in Bloomington where I'm studying Computer Science. I used to be a Biology major and before that I was a Chemistry major, but that's a different story. Now I get to concern myself with what's going on in the technology world which is great for me. I like to program in Java, I know a little bit of Scheme and I'm teaching myself Objective-C and a little C on the side. I also love pretty much everything a self-respecting nerd should love which includes but is not limited to: Star Wars, Star Trek (gasp, I like both it's okay), new tech products, old tech products, dragging people along to see nerdy movies with me, etc. This blog is going to be about what's happening in the tech world but also in my life as a developer/student/person. Hope you enjoy, hit the subscribe link if you're really interested in what I have to say.

Thanks for Reading,

Brad
